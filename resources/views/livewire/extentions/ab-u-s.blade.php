            <h5 class="abuse">  Company Profile </h5>
            <p class="pey"> Design Plus is a total graphic solutions provider with more than two-decade track record of going beyond clientsâ€™ expectations.</p> 
            <p class="pey">  Starting as a modest offset and letterpress printshop in 1985, Design Plus grew from providing simple commercial 
                offset printing solutions to complete editorial and graphic design packages.              
                Presently a one-stop shop for a wide range of print media needs, Design Plus offers the most cost- 
                and time-efficient integrated solutions that meet the stringiest requirements and most critical deadlines. </p>
            <p class="pey"> As a company, Design Plus is marked by committed management, crisp vision, and a strong entrepreneurial spirit. 
                Always on the leading edge of creativity and technology, we consistently upgrade our imaging hardware and
                software to keep up with a market that is becoming increasingly sophisticated. All these to live up beyond expectations. </p>
            <p class="pey">     Design Plus has the following three (3) main service divisions:</p>

            <h5 class="abuse">  Conventional Offset Division </h5>
            <p class="pey"> Design Plus is equipped with Heidelberg and Komori Offsets, 
                from single color to multi-color machines designed to meet the demands 
                of clients needing press run from mid (1,000 cps.) to high volume (in million cps) copies.</p> 

            <div class="hati" style="margin-top: 40px"></div>

            <h5 class="abuse"> Digital Offset Division </h5>
            <p class="pey"> Equipped with a HP Indigo 7600 Digital Offset Press machine, the 
                highest-end machine in the Philippines, this division is targeting 
                end-users and commercial clients with very short running requirements 
                (from one copy to a few hundred copies) and do not like to compromise quality. 
                Because Digital Offset eliminated the use of color-separations and plates, full color printing 
                becomes very fast and efficient, straight from workstations to the digital offset machines. Our HP Indigo 
                Press is also equipped with additional Orange, Violet, and Green inks to meet your PANTONE Color requirements 
                that most digital and offset presses cannot meet. With HP Indichrome+, your RGB images also come to life with 
                OVG inks as most CMYK-only presses fail to print orange- and violet-heavy images. Our Mac Mode color profile is 
                also friendly to professional photographers and intermediate photographers alike as the printer adjusts your RGB 
                images to print as if they were viewed in an Apple Mac display.</p>

            <h5 class="abuse"> Digital Offset Division </h5>
            <p class="pey">Equipped with industrial stitching-, folding-, cutting-, 
                and lamination machines, this division can meet most commercial post-press
                 needs from short-run requirements to medium-run requirements.</p>
